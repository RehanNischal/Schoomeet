<h2><p>
	The Lexicon Group of Institutes was established in the year 1999 by Shri S D Sharma with the sole aim of imparting high quality education in the field of management education, preprimary, primary and secondary education. The various educational institutions under the aegis of the brand name Lexicon is today synonymous for quality, visionary and progressive education. In a very short span of time the group has established a business school, top CBSE Schools, preschools(Lexicon Kids) and Junior college in Pune. Various surveys over the years have ranked the Lexicon schools as the best CBSE schools. The preschools have also been awarded for their progressive curriculum. The Lexicon group believes in student centric education and building confidence in children is at the heart of the schooling process. Lexicon provides ample opportunities of confidence building to its strong base of 6000+ students.<P>

Education is derived from a Latin word that means to bring out. Our philosophy on Education is very simple- to draw out of the child the gift of intelligence- by creating an atmosphere where inquiry and interest can be stimulated by instilling confidence in a child to believe in himself or herself. Developing intellectual curiosity, awareness and harmony, enhancing creative and critical intelligence and thinking and helping children to be valued citizens of tomorrow’s world – this is the motivation that guides The Lexicon Schools.<P>

The Lexicon group of Institutes is forging ahead and has plans of opening branches in selected cities across India.
