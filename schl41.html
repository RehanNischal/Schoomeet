<h2><p>
	The goal is to create a warm, open environment where children feel safe enough to ask questions, explore and seek answers. We challenge every child to surpass his or her own personal best and help them over the hills and through the valleys of these growing years.<P>
	The ultimate vision it has for the facility is twofold, and rooted in both the present and the future.<P>

For the present, its goal is for parents to feel good about their childcare choice, and that the children are safe, engaged, educated, and smiling. And for the future, we want these children to warmly look back at their experience with the school, and see it as a cherished part of their childhood.
