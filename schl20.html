<h2><p>TENDER HEART SCHOOL is an institution run by Atma Vishwas Instructional Society (Regd.), Chandigarh. The School was allotted land by the Chandigarh Admn. in 1991 and now has its own campus in Sector 33-B Chd., from where it has been functioning since.
<P>
TENDER HEART SCHOOL follows the progressive pattern of education and is an English Medium School. Hindi and Punjabi are parallel subject. It is well equipped with modern educational apparatus and audio visual aids. The School is co-educational and has classes from Nursery to Class X. The School is affiliated to the ICSE council, New Delhi. The present strength of the School is about One thousand (1000) students, sixty five (65) teachers and thirty (30) non teaching staff.
<P>

The children at Tender Heart School are given freedom of self-expression and are encouraged to think for themselves. In the progressive atmosphere of the modern age, the endeavor at Tender Heart School is to equip the children with a set of values so needed to bring forth a balanced individual. They are given ample opportunity of self-expression so that they learn to shoulder responsibilities in day-to-day life. Emphasis is laid on qualities such as self-restraint and truthfulness towards oneself and society. In this bewildering criss-cross of modern concepts and trends, the children are required to emerge as wholesome individuals, positively receptive to change but without forgetting their roots. Therefore, they are encouraged to respect and maintain family ties and are trained to value and imbibe traditional Indian culture with a subtle blend of modernization. Thus over the years, they develop self-confidence and the ability to discern right from wrong and move onward into the future with courage and conviction - which is our ultimate aim for all our students.
<P>

The school has a well furnished fully air-conditioned Computer Lab with the latest up-to-date computers with Multi Media and Internet. Practical training is imparted to students right from the Nursery class. We have a well stocked library with a special reference section.
<P>

Besides morning P.T. and games, the School has physical training facilities under qualified instructors in yoga,  Volley-Ball, Basket Ball, Table Tennis, Karate and Taekwondo.
<P>

Dance, Drama and Indian Classical Music form a part of the regular curriculum. Children are also taught patriotic and folk songs by our full fledged music department. Students are introduced to Indian classical vocal music as also they are trained to enjoy folk songs & light music. We also have several electronic key boards.
<P>

The School has recently raised the Green Army Eco Club of Volunteers from Class V and above to undertake action based programmes for the protection, preservation and improvement of the environment.

To awaken the children's sense of creativity and skill, we conduct regular Hobby Classes which include chess, carrom, fabric painting, wood craft, gardening and cookery.</h2>
