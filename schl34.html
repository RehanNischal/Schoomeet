<h2><p>
	At Ducklings the quality of our staff is imperative. Our teaching team consists of dedicated full-time and part-time staff, diverse in education and degreed in early childhood learning. They are trained, understand how children learn and grow, and recognize the unique qualities in each and every child. They make each day exciting, enriching and best of all â€“ the children love them!<P>
Curriculum is the perfect combination of several nationally recognized schools of thought, blended with our degreed teachers' own indigenous ideas. Our educators create the perfect learning experience for each child. We focus on how children learn and not just what they learn. All areas of early academic growth are addressed and skills are developed through layered, multi-sensory experiences over a child's infant, toddler, and preschool years. Play is at the center of our program, so activities and lessons are constructed for play with a purpose. Kids learn like school while having fun!
<P>
Off We Go! Curriculum is Ducklings' Foreign Language and World Culture Exploration Program. Created and Trademarked by Ducklings, Off We Go! is the only one of it's kind in the childcare industry! Here We Grow! and Off We Go! are offered exclusively at Ducklings Early Learning Center!<P>
