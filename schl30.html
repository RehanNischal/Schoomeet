<h2><p>Kundan International School, established in 2007 provides a truly enabling and nurturing environment where learning walks hand in hand with the cheerful, innocent and nonchalance of childhood.
<P>
Kundan International School is a dream incarnated of a great visionary and educationist, our Founder, Shri Kundan Lal ji. It is a state of art school equipped with latest technology and amenities and is striving to be the centre of excellence. <P>
In this Google age, when human knowledge and information is just in tap of a key, is conventional and structured education necessary? So why education and what is its role? Google information does not develop the ability to understand, absorb and apply information. It is traditional education alone, which apart from developing your baseline capabilities also develops your cognitive ability- to learn and solve problems, to imbibe values, distinguish between good and bad.
