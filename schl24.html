<h2><p>The school was founded in 1982 by an Anglo-Indian Catholic Principal, Harold Carver. He was previously a teacher in St. Joseph's College, Allahabad and St. John's High School, Chandigarh run by the Christian Brothers.
<P>
The school was started on 12 April 1982, as a primary school from nursery to class five with a staff of twelve members. Located in three bungalows in sector eight, arrangements were later made in sectors nine and eleven until land was allotted in Sector 45 by the UT Administration. When the first batch of Class ten passed out in 1988, the school was upgraded to senior secondary level in 1997.

In October 2010, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, from the United Kingdom, visited the school. She viewed an exhibition of models on environmental issues and another about festivals and cuisine, which was organized by the UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI). She also spoke to students at Park View Academy in Haringey, London, which is twinned with St. Stephen's, via a video link.[1][2]

The school is housed in its own four-story building with over 2400 students and 165 staff members.
At the 10th level the subjects offered include Hindi/Punjabi, English literature, English language, Computers, Mathematics, Business Studies, Accountancy, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Political Science, History, Geography, Economics, Art, and Physical Education. The student strength per classroom is 40-45.

A monthly assessment, in which each student is discussed individually, is part of the assessment system. High performing students are encouraged with monthly awards of distinction and commendation. Low performing students are placed on the house masters/headmasters list and are helped to do remedial work in their weak subjects.
