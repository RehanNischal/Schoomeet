<h2><p>CRB (Children Research
Board) is not just an institution
but an arena where a unique
methodology is adopted
through its deep research work
based on child's Psychology.
Right attitude coupled with
right action always leads to
success. We train children not
to run away from difficulties but
to march ahead to achieve the
goals of life. Our students have
given outstanding academic
r e s u l ts a l o n g w i t h t h e
participation in co-curricular
activities. Our athletes have
won laurels to the school.
Education is not our only
objective but the holistic
development is stressed upon
so that children can attain bright future perspectives. The staff and the faculty at CRB
strive to enable them to widen their intelligence and
wisdom. The chi ldren are introduced to
modernization without forgetting their roots and
moral values. This is done with the aim to explore
their hidden talents and help them to become good
citizens of our country.</h2>
