<h2><p>Living up to the School Motto 'Yearn to Learn', the fundamental aim of Saupin's is to create an environment that fosters a desire for learning, enabling children to develop spiritually, intellectually, socially, emotionally, culturally and physically. We stand committed to educate children not merely through the textbooks prescribed to them, but to provide them with knowledge that covers a wide spectrum, which will endure through the years. It is our objective to instil in our students from a tender age, through inventive and imaginative activities, a sense of fairness, a zest for honesty and truthfulness, and a keen regard for regulation and discipline. We strive to protect and make them aware of the harsh realities of life to be faced when they step into the world outside.
<p>
1. To enhance learning through creative activities and innovative teaching techniques. <br>
2. To provide a safe, loving and stable place for the younger children to learn and explore, and to provide a friendly,structured Primary, Middle and High School environment for the older children. <br>
3. To impart learning in a congenial atmosphere, while encouraging fair play, social interaction, healthy competitiveness and civic sense. <br>
4. To maintain high academic and ethical standards in order to mould our students into fine, successful human beings instilling in them a keen regard and respect for school, home, community and country. <br>
5. To offer programs that help students who are challenged with learning difficulties and to develop their potential.<br>
