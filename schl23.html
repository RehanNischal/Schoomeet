<h2><p>
The school believes in providing every child an equal opportunity to learn while feeling supported, encouraged and guided. SFHS is characterised by mutual respect between the children and educators, with everyone accepting responsibility for their own actions and behaving with care and consideration towards people and property.

The school encourages all children to develop personally and academically and to behave appropriately by, praising their achievements, writing constructive/positive comments on their work, public recognition, displaying their achievements, written reports to parents and verbal reports at parents’ meetings, discussing the children’s progress with them and agreeing on targets.

Children are encouraged to question their observations and ideas or explanations and those of others to develop logical thinking skills, and take ownership of their learning. The school motto ‘Ratione Non Vi – With Reason Not Force’, best describes the work ethos of SFHS to ensure all members of the school are happy and contented.</h2>
