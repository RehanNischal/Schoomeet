<h2><p>School will provide, in partnership with the parents, a stimulating learning environment in which every child is cared for and valued for their individuality, creativity and heritage. Within a green, safe and caring campus we will ensure that students of all ability levels are able to excel.<br>
<p>
School will encourage each student to achieve his or her full potential by promoting curiosity and enthusiasm and equip them for the demands and opportunities of the future.<br>
We will make every effort to ensure that our children leave school with:<br>

1. A set of spiritual and moral values – honesty, integrity and good judgement.<br>
2. An enquiring and discriminating mind and a desire for knowledge.<br>
3. Strong self-esteem and high personal expectation.<br>
4. Independence and confidence.<br>
5. Tolerance and respect for others.<br>

School believes that every child is entitled to enjoy his/her childhood. We want our children to take with them happy memories of the years spent with us.</h2>
